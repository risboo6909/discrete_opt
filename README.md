[Discrete optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization) course solutions in Rust

Please, be honest and don't use solutions from this repo to obtain course certificate, that way you will learn nothing. Do them yourself and enjoy!

New solutions will appear during my progress through the course.

Each week is a separate Rust program that solves particular problems. I know it would be better to organize them all as workspaces but I'm actually don't have time to refactor the code, so I'll leave them as is.
